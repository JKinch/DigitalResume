career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Iâ€™m a second year student with an interest in design and analysis of mechanical systems,
      as well computer systems and computation. For the past two terms I have become an active 
      member of the UAH Space Hardware Club. Currently I am working on Skyfire, a rocketry 
      payload submission to the AAS CanSat Competition. This term I have began to learn more 
      about networking, operating a Debian based server to do basic duties and donating 
      processing power to protein folding research.

experiences:

    - role: Lifeguard 1 & 2 and Water Safety Instructor
      time: May 2016 - August 2018
      company: Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation 
      details: |
        I worked as a lifeguard and swimming instructor at the Collins Hill Aquatics Center,
        ran by Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation. I worked four half-year seasons there 
        from May 2016 to August 2018, missing the winter 2017 season due to my freshman year
        of college. I made a name for myself by working hard, doing my duties and beyond where
        I could. I ended up learning to manage pool chemistry, got certified to run the front
        desk operation, and started opening and closing the pools at early or late hours. I 
        was often commended for the engaging, new ways I taught the material.
