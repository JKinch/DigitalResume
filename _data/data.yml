experiences:

    - role: Lifeguard 1 & 2 and Water Safety Instructor
      time: May 2016 - August 2018
      company: Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation 
      details: |
        I worked as a lifeguard and swimming instructor at the Collins Hill Aquatics Center,
        ran by Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation. I worked four half-year seasons there 
        from May 2016 to August 2018, missing the winter 2017 season due to my freshman year
        of college. In general, I surveyed the pool, responded to potential emergencies, 
        taught swimming skills, did facility maintenance and cleaning, and assisted managing
        the facility and crew. However, I made a name for myself by working hard, doing my 
        dutiesand beyond where I could. This ended up expanding my regular duties, keeping
        me busy. I ended up learning to manage pool chemistry, got certified to run the front
        desk operation, and started opening and closing the pools at early or late hours. Over
        time I became a well-regarded swimming instructor, receiving praiseful letters to the
        management and requests for me as an instructor. I was often commended for the engaging,
        new ways I taught the material, which lead to an increased student retention rate in 
        both group and private lessons.
