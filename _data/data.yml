career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Iâ€™m a second year student with an interest in design and analysis of mechanical systems,
      as well computer systems and computation. For the past two terms I have become an active 
      member of the UAH Space Hardware Club. Currently I am working on Skyfire, a rocketry 
      payload submission to the AAS CanSat Competition. This term I have began to learn more 
      about networking, operating a Debian based server to do basic duties and donating 
      processing power to protein folding research.

experiences:

    - role: Lifeguard 1 & 2 and Water Safety Instructor
      time: May 2016 - August 2018
      company: Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation 
      details: |
        I worked as a lifeguard and swimming instructor at the Collins Hill Aquatics Center,
        ran by Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation. I worked four half-year seasons there 
        from May 2016 to August 2018, missing the winter 2017 season due to my freshman year
        of college. I made a name for myself by working hard, doing my duties and beyond where
        I could. I ended up learning to manage pool chemistry, got certified to run the front
        desk operation, and started opening and closing the pools at early or late hours. I 
        was often commended for the engaging, new ways I taught the material.

    summary: |
        In October 2018, I began working as a member of a AAS CanSat Competition Team under the 
      UAH Space Hardware Club, named "Skyfire". A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, 
      integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The challenge for the students
      is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a 
      communication system, into this minimal volume.The goal of this competition is to create a
      CanSat that can control its own decent, record footage, broadcast telemetry, and record flight
      data. 
      
        Personally, I am most invloved with the Mechanical, Fight Software, and Ground Station 
      Subsystems. A majority of my mechanical design work has been in CAD modeling with computational
      fluid dynamics and finite element analysis of both the individual parts and assemblies. The 
      onboard embedded flight software is being written in C and will be running on a ATmega128Au MCU.
      Ground station code is being written in Python using the library "pyQTGraph" and "pyQt5" with a 
      basic Graphic User Interface.
      
        Currently as a team we are transitioning from the preliminary design phase to the prototyping 
      phase. We recently had our Preliminary Design Review pressentation to the competition on the 
      15th of Febuary, 2019.
