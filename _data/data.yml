    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
           I’m a third-year student with an interest in design and analysis of mechanical systems,
           as well as computer systems and computation. For the past two terms, I have become an 
           active member of the UAH Space Hardware Club. Currently, I am working on project Skyfire,
           a rocketry payload submission to the AAS CanSat Competition. This term I have begun to 
           learn more about networking, operating a Linux based server to do basic duties and 
           donating the extra processing power to the F@H protein folding research program through
           Stanford University.

experiences:

    - role: Mechanical Engineering Intern
      time: May 2019 - August 2019
      company: Mercury Systems
      details: |
        Starting in May 2019, I began working at Mercury Systems helping design structural
        elements along with thermal management solutions for various projects. The 
        workflow has been a strong mixture of both conceptional design and hands-on
        manufacturing/testing. I was responsible for overseeing the  product life-cycle
        of systems of my own design, and was allowed the chance to further branch my skills
        into Electrical Engineering and secure computing.
        
        The position started in early may and lasted through until August when I had to go
        back to studying at University full time. 
        
    - role: Lifeguard 1 & 2 and Water Safety Instructor
      time: May 2016 - August 2018
      company: Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation 
      details: |
        I worked as a lifeguard and swimming instructor at the Collins Hill Aquatics Center,
        ran by Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation. I worked four half-year seasons there 
        from May 2016 to August 2018, missing the winter 2017 season due to my freshman year
        of college. I made a name for myself by working hard, doing my duties and beyond where
        I could. I ended up learning to manage pool chemistry, got certified to run the front
        desk operation, and started opening and closing the pools at early or late hours. I 
        was often commended for the engaging, new ways I taught the material.

    intro: |
      In October 2018, I began working as a member of an AAS CanSat Competition Team under the 
      UAH Space Hardware Club, named "Skyfire". A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, 
      integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The challenge for the students
      is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a 
      communication system, into this minimal volume.The goal of this competition is to create a
      CanSat that can control it's own decent, record footage, broadcast telemetry, and record flight
      data. 
    summary: |
      Personally, I am most invloved with the Mechanical, Fight Software, and Ground Station 
      Subsystems. A majority of my mechanical design work has been in CAD modeling with computational
      fluid dynamics and finite element analysis of both the individual parts and assemblies. The 
      onboard embedded flight software is being written in C and will be running on a ATmega128Au MCU.
      Ground station code is being written in Python using the library "pyQTGraph" and "pyQt5" with a 
      basic Graphic User Interface.
      
      As of April 1st, 2019, our team in tied for 3rd worldwide in the competition due to our great 
      Preliminary Design Review presentation. For the past few weeks, early testing of our hardware, electronics,
      and software have been underway. This is being documented and presented in our Critical Design
      Review scheduled for the 15th of April.
